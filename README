Kdenlive by JasonWood <jasonwood@blueyonder.co.uk>

Kdenlive is a video editing suite for KDE and arts. It will eventually run on any machine
that KDE can run on.

This software is PRE-ALPHA - don't run it and expect anything to work whatsoever. It's not finished,
it will disappoint you.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in helping out.
