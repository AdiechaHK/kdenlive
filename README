Kdenlive V 0.2.0 by Jason Wood <jasonwood@blueyonder.co.uk>

Kdenlive is a video editing application for KDE. It will eventually run on
any machine that KDE can run on.

To use Kdenlive, you will need to download and install Piave, available from
the following webpage :

http://modesto.sourceforge.net/piave/

This version of Kdenlive requires Piave version 0.2.0. It may work with higher 
versions, but this is not guaranteed, or (at this stage of development) likely.

Then, go to the Settings->configure Kdenlive menu, and type in or browse to
the location where PIave is installed. Restart Kdenlive for the changes to take 
effect.

This is a BETA release of Kdenlive. All known major bugs have been removed, but
that doesn't mean that there aren't any. Do not try to use kdenlive to
edit any mission critical projects, and keep it away from any important
files unless you've backed them up first.

We welcome all bug reports, feedback and offers for help! so please contact me
if you have any queries or interest in Kdenlive's future.

Cheers,
Jason
