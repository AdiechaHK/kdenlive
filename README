Kdenlive 0.9.1
by Jean-Baptiste Mardelle <jb@kdenlive.org> and the Kdenlive team

Kdenlive is a video editing application based on KDE Platform 4.

Please check the project page for more information, and to report new bugs.

To use Kdenlive, you will need to download and install MLT, available from
the following web page:

http://www.mltframework.org

The recommended MLT version is 0.7.8. It may work with other
versions, but this is not guaranteed, or (at this stage of development) likely.

We welcome all bug reports, feedback, and offers for help!
