Kdenlive by Jason Wood <jasonwood@blueyonder.co.uk>

Kdenlive is a video editing application for KDE. It will eventually run on
any machine that KDE can run on.

To use Kdenlive, you will need to download and install Piave, available from
the following webpage :

http://modesto.sourceforge.net/piave/

Then, go to the Settings->configure Kdenlive menu, and type in or browse to
the location where PIave is installed. Restart Kdenlive for the changes to take 
effect.

Kdenlive is ALPHA quality software at present. Expect bugs, don't try and use
it to edit any mission critical projects, and keep it away from any important
files unless you've backed them up first.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in helping out.

Cheers,
Jason
