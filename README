Kdenlive V 0.2.2 by Jason Wood <jasonwood@blueyonder.co.uk>

Kdenlive is a video editing application for KDE. It will eventually run on
any machine that KDE can run on.

This is a development release, and has at least some known bugs. Please check the
project page for more information, and to report new bugs.

http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/kdenlive

To use Kdenlive, you will need to download and install Piave, available from
the following webpage :

http://modesto.sourceforge.net/piave/

This version of Kdenlive requires Piave version 0.2.2. It may work with different 
versions, but this is not guaranteed, or (at this stage of development) likely.

Then, go to the Settings->configure Kdenlive menu, and type in or browse to
the location where PIave is installed. Restart Kdenlive for the changes to take 
effect.

This is a BETA release of Kdenlive. All known major bugs have been removed, but
that doesn't mean that there aren't any. In particular, it is advised that you use
something more feature-complete if you have a tight deadline to reach ;-)

We welcome all bug reports, feedback and offers for help! so please contact me
if you have any queries or interest in Kdenlive's future.

Cheers,
Jason
