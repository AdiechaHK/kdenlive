* How operations on clips in the timeline are implemented (in the model)

TimelineClip->setIn (in:  number of frames relative to uncut clip (same as in MLT))
    ->setInOut()
TimelineClip->setOut(out: number of frames relative to uncut clip (same as in MLT))
    ->setInOut()
TimelineClip->setInOut(in, out)
        => ResizeClipCommand: * does not do any safety checks for available space!
                              * resizes the clip's producer,
                              * does not change its position when changing the in point!
                              * makes the clip emit resized()
                              
TimelineClip->setPosition(position, track)
        => MoveClipCommand: * does not do any safety checks for available space!
                            * inserts the same producer cut at the requested position (if on same track)
                            * inserts a new producer cut at the requested position on the requested track,
                              as avformat clips require on base producer per track (audio bugs, search ml (kdenlive-devel, mlt-devel) for more info),
                              it asks the the ProjectClip (through TimelineClip) for the base producer associated with this track, then uses it
                              to create a cut and insert it.
                            * notifies the affacted tracks, so they can update their stored clip indices
                            * makes the clip emit moved()

To create a TimelineClip:
    ProjectClip->createInstance()
To remove a TimelineClip:
    TimelineClip->remove() -> ProjectClip->removeInstance()

=> 4 basic operations: add, remove, resize, move
These four operations should be enough to achieve everything imaginable,
without the need to use the MLT API.
Because they do not perform safety checks they should never be used directly (without performing checks).
As set of "compiled operations" can be directly used from the UI or from plugins.

Moving Helper:
    The UI can use a moving helper from the model, to check if a move is allowed,
    the moving helper provides alternative positions if a move is not possible, or because of snapping.
