"Before editing video on computer was possible, most editing was done on "
"linear editors - these work by having essentially, two video recorders. The "
"first would hold the video that you are editing together, and the second "
"would be used to find the next clip that you want to record. Find a clip, "
"record it, find the next clip, record it. This is called linear editing "
"because the medium of tape forced things to be edited sequentially. If you "
"have edited 10 minutes worth of footage together, and decide that you made a "
"mistake after five minutes, you can't just \"push\" the last five minutes "
