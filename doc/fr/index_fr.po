"Before editing video on computer was possible, most editing was done on "
"linear editors - these work by having essentially, two video recorders. The "
"first would hold the video that you are editing together, and the second "
"would be used to find the next clip that you want to record. Find a clip, "
"record it, find the next clip, record it. This is called linear editing "
"because the medium of tape forced things to be edited sequentially. If you "
"have edited 10 minutes worth of footage together, and decide that you made a "
"mistake after five minutes, you can't just \"push\" the last five minutes "
"around to add space for new clips."

"Non-linear editing is by far a more flexible way of editing. You can place "
"clips anywhere within your final video (in Kdenlive, this is represented via "
"the timeline), and you can move them around as much as you want, rearrange "
"them in a completely different order. Best of all, at any point during this "
"you can press play and (with a sufficiently powerful computer) watch back "
"what you have done there and then."
