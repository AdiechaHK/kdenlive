TODO List

Urgent
- effect detection / editing for kdenlive
- other-than-DV support for piave (ffmpeg?)
- DV capture dialog

Less urgent
* (Kdenlive) KDockWidget layouts need to be saved on exit/opened on loading.
* (Kdenlive) Dragging a clip to the timeline with undefined length should become full-length once it's duration is known.

This is not a comprehensive list :-) If you are interested in helping
