TODO List

Urgent
* (Kdenlive, Piave) extensive support of ffmpeg libraries to allow more video format, both in input and output.
* (Kdenlive, Piave) DV capture from video camera.
* (Kdenlive, Piave) choose a common library of effects to avoid maintaining our own effect system.

Less urgent
* (Kdenlive) KDockWidget layouts need to be saved on exit/opened on loading.
* (Kdenlive) Dragging a clip to the timeline with undefined length should become full-length once it's duration is known.

This is not a comprehensive list :-) If you are interested in helping
